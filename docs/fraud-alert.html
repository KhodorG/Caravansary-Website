            <h2 class="section-title">Employment</h2>
            <p>Please be aware of spoof e-mails and fake job postings that appear to be from well-known companies, including Caravansary Capital. To bait you, an e-mail or job posting may offer you an immediate employment opportunity, then ask you to submit personal information or give you direction to begin work immediately. These fake emails and job postings are an attempt to gain your private information through fraudulent methods.</p>
            <p>Please note Caravansary Capital does not make offers of employment prior to completion of a thorough hiring process, which includes a face-to-face interview. The company does not request any type of payment from the candidate during the hire process.</p>
            <p>If you have received an offer of employment and you have not participated in a face-to-face interview with Caravansary Capital, the correspondence you received is fraudulent and should be disregarded.</p>

        <section class="fraud-alert-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Checks</h2>
            <p>Individuals should exercise caution if they receive unexplained checks payable to them and that appear to be coming from Caravansary Capital or appear to be drawn upon a Caravansary Capital bank account. Caravansary Capital does not typically send checks to anyone unless the company is doing business with that individual.</p>
            <p>Never deposit any check into your bank account unless you are sure it is genuine.</p>

        <section class="fraud-alert-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Payment Instructions</h2>
            <p>Be aware of efforts by third-parties to illegally obtain payments through fraudulent emails or other forms of communication to provide new and different payment instructions. Please do not act upon or accept any request to change the payment instructions specified in your contract with Caravansary Capital unless the communication comes directly from the Financial Manager’s office of Caravansary Capital in writing by regular mail and you follow up with a phone call to Caravansary Capital at a number you know to be accurate.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Fraudulent Purchase Order</h2>
            <p>Fraudulent Purchase Order schemes include imposters posing as an employee of a company. These imposters place orders for materials and equipment over the phone or via email that looks or sounds like Caravansary Capital email account; using the actual name, address and title of a Caravansary Capital employee; and/or providing a phone number that when called is always answered “Caravansary Capital”.</p>
            <p>Imposters provide false purchase order and/or contract numbers; stress that the order needs to be expedited; and explain that there may not be someone on-site to sign for the delivery but ask you to leave it at the site without a signature.</p>

            <h3>What you can do</h3>
            <p>Confirm the order with Caravansary Capital prior to fulfilling the order by contacting the main office for Caravansary Capital listed on the company website. If you are an existing Caravansary Capital vendor, call the office you usually do business with. Do not use the phone number that was provided with the order and do not use email or text. Ask to speak to the Project Manager on the job that the order is for, or the Office Financial Manager. Please contact us to report an imposter as well. Caravansary Capital will take the necessary steps to prevent these incidents from occurring in the future.</p>
